TDH=Transwarp Data Hub, the one-stop Hadoop distribution, consists of Apache Hadoop, 5 Transwarp brand system software, the big data development tool set - Transwarp Studio, plus several software which are underline services for security or management.
ARGODB=Transwarp ArgoDB is a flash-based distributed database. It is capable of real-time multi-dimensional retrieval, quasi real-time analysis and offline analysis. Data is not required to be stored as multiple copies, thus the costs of hardware, implementation, operation and maintenance would be reduced.
SOPHON=Transwarp Sophon, a general AI platform, enables enterprise users to easily build the corresponding AI applications by modeling automation, built-in industry templates and APIs with pre-trained AI models.
KUNDB=Transwarp KunDB is capable of processing massive data as well as providing linear scalability for storage and computing, and it can also apply to high-concurrency situations. It guarantees high availability via consensus algorithm, resulting in consistency across datacenters and enabling system updates and patch installation without ceasing services. KunDB provides full support for SQL which contains the syntax fulfilled by traditional RDB without additional cost for learning.
